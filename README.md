# MyUsefullComponents
This is a repository for my latest project, which is an application that helps people track their fitness goals.
It's built with React on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. The app allows users to log their workouts, set goals, and track their progress over time.



React TodoBox Component
This is a TodoBox component built using React. It provides a simple interface for creating and managing a list of tasks.

Features
Add tasks by typing in the input field and pressing the "add" button.
Finish a task by clicking on its checkbox. Finished tasks will move to the bottom of the list.
Activate a finished task by clicking on its checkbox again. Active tasks will move to the top of the list.
Tasks are persisted using Axios and a RESTful API.
